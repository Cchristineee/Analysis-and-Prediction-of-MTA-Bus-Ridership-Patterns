# Analysis and Prediction of MTA Bus Ridership Patterns

<strong>Project Overview</strong>

This project explores temporal and environmental factors, such as weather and holidays, and their impact on MTA bus ridership. Using regression models and clustering algorithms, we 
analyze and predict ridership trends while identifying patterns across different routes.

<strong>Reseach Question:</strong>
What effects do weather, time, and route-specific factors have on bus ridership, and how well can machine learning models predict future attendance?

<strong>Methods and Approach: </strong>
- Regression Modeling
- <strong>Goal:</strong> Predict bus ridership based on temporal and environmental factors.

<strong>Models Used:</strong>
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost
- Linear Regression
- Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R¬≤ Score
- Clustering Analysis

<strong>Goal:</strong> Group bus routes based on similar ridership patterns.
- Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering
- Evaluation Metric: Silhouette Score
- Feature Engineering
- Incorporating features like weather conditions, holidays, time of day, and route-specific identifiers.
Data Validation
- Cross-validation techniques to ensure robust model performance.

<strong>Tools and Technologies</strong>

<strong>Programming Language:</strong> Python
<strong>Libraries:</strong> 
- <strong>Data Processing:</strong> pandas, numpy
- <strong>Visualization:</strong> matplotlib, seaborn
- <strong>Machine Learning:</strong> scikit-learn, xgboost

<strong>üîÆ Future Directions </strong>
-Extend the analysis to include more granular data, such as demographic information.
-Explore time series-specific algorithms for improved predictions.
-Develop a dashboard for visualizing ridership trends in real time.
